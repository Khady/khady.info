How to properly configure the editor for someone using both <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">ReasonML</a>
installed from the <a href="https://github.com/reasonml/reason-cli#install">reason-cli</a> and OCaml from opam? This question
arises when we are doing both native and bucklescript development.
</p>

<p>
First thing to remember is that all the editor plugins that really
need configuration are based on <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/merlin">merlin</a> (as far as I know). More
precisely on the ocamlmerlin binary. And they will either take the
first ocamlmerlin binary they will find in the path, or the binary
from the currently selected opam switch.
</p>

<p>
The configuration presented bellow allows us to properly configure our
environment prior to launch Emacs (with <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/tuareg">tuareg</a> or <a href="https://github.com/reasonml-editor/reason-mode">reason-mode</a>),
<a href="https://github.com/reasonml-editor/vscode-reasonml">vscode</a>, vim, &#x2026; Once this is done, we can launch our editor from the
shell with the expected environment and it will pickup the good
version of merlin. In theory it is also possible to launch our editor
from our OS launcher rather than from the editor, but then we have to
be sure to load the good environment globally. And it doesn't
correspond to the usual workflow when mixing native and bucklescript
development. So I will not try to get to this point.
</p>

<p>
I am using yarn rather than npm because I am more familiar with it and
the global installation system seems easier to manage. But I guess it
is possible to reach the same state with npm.
</p>

<p>
Also I am using opam2 because it provides nice new features over opam1
and is already very stable.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge4a60b7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge4a60b7">Putting merlin in the environment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge4a60b7">
<p>
Once we have installed reason-cli globally using yarn, we will have
the <code>ocamlmerlin</code> binary in a path like <code>$HOME/.yarn/bin</code>. We can get
this path from the command <code>yarn global bin</code>.
</p>

<p>
For opam, the binary will be in <code>$HOME/.opam/SWITCH/bin</code>. And this
can be added to our path by calling <code>eval $(opam env --sw=SWITCH)</code>.
</p>

<p>
So what we want to do is just to add one of those two paths to the
environment and then launch our editor.
</p>

<p>
By hand in bash, it would be something like this for yarn:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span class="org-variable-name">PATH</span>=<span class="org-string">"$(</span><span class="org-sh-quoted-exec">yarn</span><span class="org-string"> global bin):$PATH"</span> emacs
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And like this for opam:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span class="org-variable-name">PATH</span>=<span class="org-string">"$(</span><span class="org-sh-quoted-exec">opam</span><span class="org-string"> env --switch=SWITCH):$PATH"</span> emacs
</pre>
</div>

<p>
But it is troublesome to do this every time we want to launch our
editor. It is actually very troublesome because we have to prefix all
the commands that are using binaries from yarn or opam.
</p>

<p>
So we want to update our environment globally for the current
shell. This can be done with <code>export</code>. But it is even easier to use a
small utility like <i>direnv</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdec7105" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdec7105">Automatic environment setup using direnv</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdec7105">
<p>
<a href="https://direnv.net/">direnv</a> behavior is pretty simple. It will look for a <code>.envrc</code> file
in the current directory or any of its parents. This <code>.envrc</code> file is
actually a bash script that is sourced by direnv once found. Every
time we change directory, it will look for a <code>.envrc</code> and update our
environment.
</p>

<p>
The configuration of direnv for each shell is a bit different. I will
not detail it here. It is better to check the <a href="https://github.com/direnv/direnv#setup">direnv documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
The important parts are what to put in the <code>.envrc</code> file and where to
put this file.
</p>

<p>
The answer to where is at the root of our project.
</p>

<p>
And the content of the file is actually very short.
</p>

<p>
For a project using opam (so targeting native or bytecode
compilation):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"><span class="org-builtin">eval</span> $<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span><span class="org-sh-quoted-exec">opam</span> env --shell=bash --inplace-path --set-switch --readonly --switch=SWITCH<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If we are using a local switch, the <code>--switch=SWITCH</code> part can be
removed.
</p>

<p>
For a project using reason-cli (targeting javascript by using
bucklescript), the configuration is not much longer:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">PATH_add $<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span><span class="org-sh-quoted-exec">yarn</span> global bin<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>PATH_add</code> is a function <a href="https://github.com/direnv/direnv#the-stdlib">provided by direnv</a>.
</p>

<p>
Then we need to execute <code>direnv allow</code> to tell direnv we know about
the <code>.envrc</code> in the directory of our project and it is
legitimate. This is only needed when we create a new <code>.envrc</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once all this is done, our <code>.envrc</code> should be automatically used by
direnv. We can check if it works by executing <code>which ocamlmerlin</code> and
making sure this is actually the merlin binary we want to use.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5eff3d1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5eff3d1">Launching the editor</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5eff3d1">
<p>
We are now ready to launch the editor. To do so, we need to be in the
project directory so that direnv does it jobs. And then execute
<code>emacs</code>, <code>code .</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>atom</code> or any other command corresponding to
our favorite editor. That's all.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org153e015" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org153e015">Benefits</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org153e015">
<p>
Using direnv allows us to use reason-cli or opam for a project. Or
even both. But it also has other benefits. One of them very valuable
is to reuse the same switch for multiple directories. This is very
convenient while using git worktree.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7c24462" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7c24462">Note concerning emacs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7c24462">
<p>
I am not sure how all the editors plugins are working. But for Emacs
by default the merlin package will try to look for the ocamlmerlin
binary in opam. Even if the environment has not been populated by
<code>opam env</code>. This behavior is not the one expected here. It would take
merlin from opam even if we added the reason-cli's merlin to our
path. It is not hard to change this behavior though. Just add this
line to Emacs configuration:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span><span class="org-keyword">setq</span> merlin-command <span class="org-string">"ocamlmerlin"</span><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The whole Emacs configuration I am using for reason and OCaml is
available in this <a href="https://github.com/Khady/emacs.d/blob/master/config.org#ocamlreason">GitHub repository</a>. It also makes the configuration
of <code>reason-mode</code> more robust. For someone using <code>use-package</code>, it
should automatically install everything that it required.
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="https://github.com/wbolster/emacs-direnv">direnv package for Emacs</a> that could allow us to skip
configuration of the environment prior to launch Emacs. But using this
plugin rather than setting up the environment first has a big
disadvantage. As soon as we will jump to a file which is not in a
sub-directory of the <code>.envrc</code> file, merlin will not be in the path. If
we use <code>merlin-locate</code> on a function or value coming from a library
installed by opam it will work. But it is not possible to use merlin
in the file we landed in.
</p>

<p>
Note that this problem doesn't exist while using yarn or local
switches with opam because all the installed libraries will be in
sub-directories or <code>.envrc</code>.
